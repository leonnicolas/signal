Loosely coupled helper library for Observability Signals

For now this is a collection of helpers I use across various projects.  
The goal is to have compatible Observability packages, that still can be used on their own.

## Packages

### health

This package is based on [heptiolabs/healthcheck](https://github.com/heptiolabs/healthcheck) package with some tweaks to improve metrics.
